In order to provide better experience to Galaxy users we plan to work on the following improvements.


homebrew
------------
- prepare versioned homebrew-science tap (using the hackathon formula), possibly automated
- match all dependencies maintained by the MTS (~400 package* repos) to their counterparts in brew
- implement proof-of-concept galaxyside brew dependency resolution for one complex-enough tool (cufflinks?)

TS 1.0 UX
-------
- implement 'pull from github' functionality on TS repositories

TS 2.0
-------
- come up with 'good enough' (TM) conversion of tools from TS 1.0 to TS 2.0 that will 
improve the probabilty of being able to get rid of the TS 1.0 in the future
