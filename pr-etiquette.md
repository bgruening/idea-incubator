*An effort to specify how to approach PRs gracefully so everybody is having a good time*


Perception is to be that, as a PR creator, I am showing you my code not in order to be approved 
but to share and discuss my intentions of improving the code we work on together. 

The boss-employee relationship created by the 'begging for approval mindset'
does not encourage healthy discussion and should be overriden by peer-to-peer approach.

Even if PRs are mandatory in order to contribute to the codebase the message should be so that 
the PR creator could have committed directly but instead chose the more difficult way in 
order to contribute a superior changeset. 


* open PR with finished work or label it properly (do not make it difficult for potential testers)
keep technical
* do not nitpick
* do not make the author implement stuff you think is good; he/she is not your employee
* use vetoes very sparsely
* do not threaten to veto
